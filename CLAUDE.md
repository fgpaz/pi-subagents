# CLAUDE.md — pi-subagents Agentic Engineering Policy

> **Authority**: Project documentation and operator context + AE-KERNEL-V2.md. **Language**: English. L0 operating policy for pi-subagents.

## North Star Cycle

Wiki is the only source of truth.

1. **Context** — wiki anchor + mi-lsp implication graph + architecture decisions from wiki: query live at decision boundaries; never reuse a context snapshot.
2. **Build** — gate-free; implement **all** code/docs for the goal (no C2 tests/builds/lints). Lanes are not completion.
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE** — parent only, when `implementation_frontier` is green and writers are idle.
4. **Verify once** — single FINAL_VERIFY wave (build/tests/impact map); not per lane. FAST local: collapsed `verify_packet`.
5. **Wiki close** — update wiki if drift. Drift is wiki vs shipped behavior, not omitted `.docs/wiki` files. Product-visible shipped work without RS/FL/RF/TP/TECH coverage is drift; FAST still runs `ps-asistente-wiki` plus targeted `ps-trazabilidad` then `ps-auditar-trazabilidad` at FAST depth when that drift exists or the operator asked for ciclo AE / `full_cycle_to_origin_main`. Collapsed `verify_packet` compresses C2; it does not replace wiki routing or FAST-depth trace/audit. Skip targeted wiki+trace only for mechanical no-wiki-impact diffs (typo/format/no user-visible behavior). Do not wait to be re-asked.
6. **Full cycle default** — verify_packet (collapsed or full trace/audit) → close drifts → pre-push → integrate `origin/main` → **always** sanitize deprecated branches/worktrees → learning route (`ps-wiki-aprendizaje` only with pilot/qa inputs; else friction/skipped_fast). Next session: `ps-contexto` reentry of last classification + open friction (do not re-ask).

## Chief of Staff (strict)

The principal session is **Chief of Staff**, not a leaf implementer.

- **Principal does**: understand intent, prioritize, route (`mi-lsp skills plan` when multi-skill), launch leaves, monitor, join via anti-C2 contract, decide, stitch compact results, **own goal phase** (`BUILDING` → `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` → `FINAL_VERIFY`) and **session-state** index.
- **Leaves do**: read, edit within bounded scope; report `lane_implementation_done` with paths only; **no** C2 validation, no phase change, no subdelegation, push, deploy, or final closure.
- **Join ≠ FINAL_VERIFY** at leaf **or** axis/child-orchestrator: never run build/test/lint when a lane or sub-orchestrator finishes (locked A). Parent rejects joins with C2 evidence (`accept-join`).
- **C2 deferred** until goal-root IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE unless the operator **explicitly** requests a bounded intermediate check (B = ALLOW_SPOT; never hard-block the operator for asking).
- **Same-repo FAST (1–few files, reversible)**: almost-zero ceremony — no preflight ritual, no session-contract required. Principal may implement directly only when isolation/fan-out cost exceeds value.
- **Non-trivial / multi-file / multi-axis**: launch leaves; do not expand the principal into full implementation.
- Leaf dispatch is ROI-positive: spawn when separable ownership and expected value beat orchestration cost. Adapter availability alone never forces a worker.
- If spawn is blocked: announce owner_surface + rule + how_to_unblock. Silent multi-axis parent-implement is forbidden.
- `writing-plans` is for orchestrator→leaf task packets only, not a human-facing ceremony.
- **Operator-facing language**: answer what the operator asked first, in their language and words; name lanes by what they do ("the lane fixing compaction"), never by pane/lane/test codes alone; orchestration detail (screens, statuses, watchers, retries) only on request. A lane — herdr, another session or an in-harness subagent — is reported as goal, stage and result.

## Context rules (ps-contexto)

- **Flujos** = mi-lsp implication graph around the task (`nav flow-slice`, `change-pack`, `related`, `neighbors`, `affected`, `explain-change`) — not wiki `FL-*` alone.
- Load **architecture decisions** from the wiki; never re-decide or forget locks already documented.
- Route-first mi-lsp: prefer `nav batch` + `nav multi-read`; depth `policy` for kernel/skill-only (skip product/UX/negocio gates).
- Session SoT: goal intent + selectors/scope locks + locked decisions + goal-phase. Graph topology/bindings/readiness are queried live at boundaries, never stored as session SoT.

## Native context entry and four mi-lsp modes

For every real work task, enter through the native `ps-contexto` and `mi-lsp` skills and actually invoke the tool; skill availability or a text mention is not tool-use evidence. The native harness owns invocation, lifecycle, and monitoring. `ps-contexto` obtains the minimum useful cheap bounded live context (wiki anchor and decisions, scope locks, and a small implication slice), then supplies exact follow-up queries for implementation. Greetings, status chat, and repeated literal getters do not restart a full workflow; no full-wiki/status/governance preflight is required for every task.

Preferred commands only:
- **Goal-shaped navigation** starts with `mi-lsp nav intent "<goal>"`.
  - Follow the exact `continuation.next` command when it is emitted.
  - Use the exact `expansions[].command` when an expansion is requested, preserving its reason.
- **Literal non-goal operations** remain direct:
  - `mi-lsp nav wiki <query>` for canonical wiki/document operations.
  - `mi-lsp nav route <task>` for a literal route request.
  - `mi-lsp nav search <pattern>` for a literal text/search request.
- Follow the returned bounded continuation before widening a query; do not invent a broader command.

Allowed fallback codes are exactly:
- `unsupported_operation`
- `unavailable_binary`
- `invalid_workspace`
- `explicit_incomplete`

Fallback requires one visible `reason_code` from this list and a separate bounded detail; do not use a generic fallback chain.
Goal-shaped requests start with cheap `mi-lsp nav intent "<goal>"` discovery, then consume the exact emitted `continuation.next`, `expansions[].command`, or literal supported executable `next_queries` values when emitted; these field names are not an exclusive whitelist. Inspect actual returned values; do not execute query terms or derive commands from prose. Do not invent a closed follow-up operation whitelist. Literal named mi-lsp/wiki/code commands go direct. Select the smallest applicable mode:

1. **Canonical wiki** — read governed wiki roots and architecture decisions; wiki remains the authority.
2. **General linked documentation/knowledge ("Obsidian-like")** — follow existing map, root, and linked metadata; do not fabricate SDD/RS requirements or promote notes to canon.
3. **LSP/code graphs** — use LSP symbols and references plus graph callers, callees, and tests; do not eagerly load the full graph.
4. **Combined bidirectional traversal** — traverse either direction through existing `wiki_code_context` lanes, keeping the node/link set bounded.

Readers follow bounded nodes and links, not repeated broad `rg` scans. Preserve typed fallback reasons and honest `unavailable`/`partial` results; distinguish candidates, declared bindings, and observed runtime data; surface stale graph state; and retain documented boundaries and wiki architecture locks. If mi-lsp is unavailable, use the existing fallback path only with that typed reason and no invented command or public API.

A real invocation must produce runtime evidence only through existing native invocation plus mi-lsp session/operation evidence; do not add a recorder, fabricate savings, rewrite directives with tool regexes, or make a mandatory hook. After implementation, the goal owner performs one goal-level wiki drift check and owns any meaningful wiki update (no-op writes are forbidden), then `ps-trazabilidad`, then the independent read-only `ps-auditar-trazabilidad`. Keep one owner skill at a time, no per-leaf tests/audits, no second full-suite authorization, and no automatic push or deletion authority.

## FAST same-repo ceremony (almost zero)

- No mandatory session-contract for same-repo FAST.
- No mandatory preflight suite for local reversible work.
- Pre-push minimum: `.\infra\git\Invoke-PrePushGuard.ps1 -CollaborationMode solo` (secrets scan + main ancestry + no force-push path).
- Escalate ceremony only for multi-axis work, live/runtime, secrets, external side effects, or explicit HOLD.
- **Completion default** remains full cycle to `origin/main` + **always** sanitize deprecated worktrees/branches unless the operator says local-only. No HOLD whose only message is “please integrate/clean yourself”. Leaving known-deprecated artifacts is incomplete.
- FAST close uses **collapsed verify_packet** (not two full trace+audit tours of the same evidence).

## Kernel Fast Runtime v3

```toon
policy_revision: kernel-fast-governance-v4
execution_mode: FAST
closure_profile: governed_kernel_change
build_loop: {tests: false, audits: false, traceability: false, evidence: false, structural_check_max_seconds: 0, c2_validation: false}
final_verify: {count: 1, method: impact_map, fresh_verifier: required, single_wave: true, trace_audit: combined_single_pass, forbid_duplicate_evidence_tours: true}
evidence: {mode: only_publish, packet: single_closure_packet, durable_before_publish: false}
```

BUILD LOOP is gate-free. FINAL VERIFY runs once with a fresh verifier. Publish only one sanitized closure packet. External-only actions are BLOCKED without an explicit allowlist and explicit closure authorization. Completion handoff must not infer authority for commit, push, merge, remote mutation, deletion, or evidence reaping.

## Project Management / Tracker Applicability

Tracker mode: `external` (`enabled`).

- external: selected tracker adapter owns tickets/claims/sync; never invent GraphQL or shared state vocabulary.
- none / local-only: local session frontier + git own the workflow; no external tracker mutation; never publish tracker no-op fillers.
- Traceability/audit/pre-push remain mode-aware and must not invent external tracker requirements in local-only mode.

## Language Rule

Keep `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and project-local skills in English. All other project documentation is in Spanish.

## Collaboration Rules

**Style**: avoid emojis in policy/governance outputs. User-facing copy must preserve correct Spanish orthography.

**Mandatory wrappers** (never bypass when the wrapper expresses the action):
  - name: secret-management
    script: mi-key-cli
    precondition: Resolve credentials through the configured vault; never store secret values in repository files.
    authority: repository policy

**private network precondition**: before remote or deployment operations, confirm private access to the target environment.


## Repository-Specific Contract

### Repository Description

Pi subagent orchestration library forked from its public upstream.

### Repository Structure Rules

  - AGENTS.md is generated policy; retain its upstream requirement to read VISION.md before product, architecture, scope, or backlog decisions.
  - VISION.md is the acceptance policy; preserve the upstream project boundaries and evidence requirements.
  - This repository owns Pi delegation, child launch contracts, workflow orchestration, supervision, observability, and result handoff; it is not a general project manager or tracker.
  - Keep upstream product/runtime behavior and dependency declarations unchanged in this AE setup.
  - No GitHub Actions workflows; validation and automation must not introduce GitHub Actions.
  - Use a single writer for repository mutations; avoid compaction as a workflow or coordination mechanism.
  - Do not commit secrets, tokens, OAuth material, .env files, or raw customer data.

### Mandatory Wrappers

  - name: secret-management
    script: mi-key-cli
    precondition: Resolve credentials through the configured vault; never store secret values in repository files.
    authority: repository policy

### QA Canon Paths

  - README.md

### Additional Local Rules

  - The repository is a fork of an upstream public library; preserve upstream scope, compatibility, and ownership boundaries.
  - No new product promises or RS/RF/TP artifacts are introduced by AE setup.
